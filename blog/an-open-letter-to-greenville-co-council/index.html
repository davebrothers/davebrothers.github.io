    <br> <div class="text-justify"><p>I have been a resident of Greenville county for over twenty years and a homeowner in District 18 for about 5 of them now. There are a great many things I love about this place that keep me here: being near my family, the Blue Ridge right out my back door, and a scenic commute up Highway 129 every day to my job at the Roger Milliken Center to name a few. Moreover, I have enjoyed watching the story of Greenville county as it has evolved into a bona fide jewel in the crown of the South. It’s a compelling tale of civic progress punctuated by personal, family, and community success celebrated by many folks from Simpsonville to Slater-Marietta.</p>

<p>Many. But not all. Not even nearly enough.The so-called Family Values Resolution of 1996 stands as a pitiful stain on this story, and it’s past time we put pen to paper as a community and retracted it. Its arrogance is surpassed only by its current inaccuracy, stating as supposed fact a whole host of fallacies intended to do nothing more than demean and dehumanize LGBTQ individuals. To wit:</p>

<p>If non-cis-hetero family units are sub-optimal for raising children, why do we in Greenville county have a passionate population of same-sex families fostering, adopting, and raising healthy, well-adjusted children in happy homes? If we as the queer contingent are insufficient to provide a support network for the elderly, why do so many of us labor to hold up the institutions that administer their care or choose to remain here to care for our own aging family members? If a gay relationship can’t communicate family values, how then have my husband and I supported each other for 17 years in Greenville county and built a loving, safe home here? And since <i>Lawrence v. Texas</i> and, closer to home, <i>Condon v. Haley</i>, show me please what laws decrying our very existence stand on South Carolina’s books today.</p>

<p>In a recent study conducted by the Williams Institute and expounded upon by USC Upstate, nearly 20% of LGBTQ respondents when asked reported having moved because they felt specifically unwelcome. These vitriolic statements are actively hurting the cause of Greenville county by driving talent, skilled labor, and community involvement away. In 1978, when Gilbert Baker chose the rainbow in what would become the most recognizable of LGBTQ symbols, he chose it because it’s representative of all people. And as part of the rainbow of humanity, we will not be broken, marginalized, or maligned by these statements any longer. We will not take lightly inaction on the part of our representatives in acknowledging that on some very basic, fundamental level this resolution is without merit.</p>

<p>We are a people standing here today, galvanized by the indecency of the attitudes expressed by members of this council to remind it that we are Greenville county and we’re not going away.</p>
