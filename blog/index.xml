      <title>An Open Letter to Greenville County Council</title>

      <description>In the twenty years since my family came to Greenville county, I have enjoyed watching it evolve into a bona fide jewel in the crown of the South. Its tale is a compelling one of civic progress punctuated by personal, family, and community success celebrated by many folks from Simpsonville to Slater-Marietta.
Many. But not enough. The so-called Family Values Resolution of 1996 stands as a pitiful stain on this story, and it’s past time we as a community retracted it in full.</description>

      <description>We left this morning,around 3,when the pull of the moonwas so fiercethat little trickles of river watercame marching through the sliding door,and we prayed.As we followed Polaris out of town,we swept around thechair of Cassiopeia,mouthing herlip servicesand sweet-nothing niceties, lifting her our complimentarysacrifices,our whispered lambs.I wondered what __________ would do.Out Highway 99,the rivers were topping outover the surface of the road -–Our green Ethiopia is falling,we murmured over the low droneof the engine bearing us away,Can you still not stay Poseidon’s wrath?</description>

      <description>Got to play the WSSL stage at Spartanburg&amp;rsquo;s Spring Fling this year with The Social Contracts. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t heard TSC yet, make sure to check out the self-titled album from this past year. The city of Spartanburg was, of course, a gracious host and really knows how to put on a polished street fair.

      <title>Lights, Camera, Cure</title>

      <description>This all started with an unassuming deal. I’d “take care of myself,” and Mom would do everything in her power to move the needle closer to a cure. Neither of us had the foresight to even begin wrapping our minds around what that would come to mean in these first twenty years. We just knew we had an arrangement. So we shook on it. We used our hands to bind it.</description>

      <title>The Light Bulb Limiter</title>

      <description>In today&amp;rsquo;s episode, Dave gets struck by enLIGHTenment.
Sound, like light, is energy. We hear and feel sound in waves, vibrations that move through the air, the wall, the floor. If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever pulled up to a stop light and heard some super-loud jams, you have the idea. So music moves us: not just emotionally, but physically. To me, that duplicitous sensory experience is just one of the things that makes it awesome.</description>

      <description>There was only the momentand the mourning –sheer black veilsand the silence that pricksmoving out of the stage lightand into blackmerging into blackmerging into black.
Silence is not enough,he said, narrating,and clappedlike the thunder that spokein the first wash ofwet noisein the first lightof an August morning –It is the thunder that endures,the primordial Donnerthat blinds more than the Blitz.There were mumblingsin the lobby that night,low utterances of wasteand the thin flick ofspent tickets in the handsof those who failed to speak.</description>

      <description>HumanBeingHumanIt is our privilege and burden to struggle toward understanding. As soon as we think we have it, we find holes in the bottoms of its pockets and we go further looking for the key we are sure was just there. Scraping, scrounging.
On Duval Street, there are candles rocking in the evening breeze: golden cat&amp;rsquo;s eyes twinkle and sway. There are colors draped and stretched tight to catch the last soft whispers of light before they&amp;rsquo;re gone over the rim of blue-green creation.</description>

      <title>A Question of Image</title>
      <link>https://davebrothers.com/blog/a-question-of-image/</link>

      <description>Working in development for the last couple of years, I have tried to understand what feels like an obsession with image within the culture of &amp;ldquo;computering&amp;quot;*. Often &amp;ndash; too often &amp;ndash; I catch conversations among computerers derailing the sensibility train by combatively aligning with something as simple as a text editor. Like politics, like sports, like essentially any institution left to the devices of man, computering has a seedy underbelly of elitism derived from personal preference which is mired in whole flocks of grown men and women acting like they are superior in some way to others because of the toys in their toy box.</description>

      <description>Who doesn&amp;rsquo;t love a Raspberry Pi? The little cruncher that can has spent the last couple of years redefining accessibility, portability, and utility in a palm-sized package. I&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed their practicality and approachability at work and at play: app servers, radios, Hubots, and the list goes on. At work, one of the neater applications we&amp;rsquo;ve had for it has been as a series of kiosk displays around campus that report stats on sales, performance, and logistics to everyone.</description>
