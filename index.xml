Got to play the WSSL stage at Spartanburg&amp;rsquo;s Spring Fling this year with The Social Contracts. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t heard TSC yet, make sure to check out the self-titled album from this past year. The city of Spartanburg was, of course, a gracious host and really knows how to put on a polished street fair.

      <title>Lights, Camera, Cure</title>

      <description>This all started with an unassuming deal. I’d “take care of myself,” and Mom would do everything in her power to move the needle closer to a cure. Neither of us had the foresight to even begin wrapping our minds around what that would come to mean in these first twenty years. We just knew we had an arrangement. So we shook on it. We used our hands to bind it.</description>

      <description>In today&amp;rsquo;s episode, Dave gets struck by enLIGHTenment.
Sound, like light, is energy. We hear and feel sound in waves, vibrations that move through the air, the wall, the floor. If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever pulled up to a stop light and heard some super-loud jams, you have the idea. So music moves us: not just emotionally, but physically. To me, that duplicitous sensory experience is just one of the things that makes it awesome.</description>

Being

It is our privilege and burden to struggle toward understanding. As soon as we think we have it, we find holes in the bottoms of its pockets and we go further looking for the key we are sure was just there. Scraping, scrounging.
On Duval Street, there are candles rocking in the evening breeze: golden cat&amp;rsquo;s eyes twinkle and sway.</description>

      <title>A Question of Image</title>

Like any other subculture, computering* attracts participants with some interesting personality quirks that can lend themselves to a certain degree of generalization. So many of us like to say we disapprove of stereotypes, and while they typically don&amp;rsquo;t do any favors for presupposition and blind judgement, they exist for a reason.
For the last couple of years, I have worked to understand what feels like an obsession with image within this subculture.</description>

Who doesn&amp;rsquo;t love a Raspberry Pi? The little cruncher that can has spent the last couple of years redefining accessibility, portability, and utility in a palm-sized package. I&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed their practicality and approachability at work and at play: app servers, radios, Hubots, and the list goes on. At work, one of the neater applications we&amp;rsquo;ve had for it has been as a series of kiosk displays around campus that report stats on sales, performance, and logistics to everyone.</description>
