Got to play the WSSL stage at Spartanburg&amp;rsquo;s Spring Fling this year with The Social Contracts. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t heard TSC yet, make sure to check out the self-titled album from this past year.

      <description>In today&amp;rsquo;s episode, Dave gets struck by enLIGHTenment.
Sound, like light, is energy. We hear and feel sound in waves, vibrations that move through the air, the wall, the floor. If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever pulled up to a stop light and heard some super-loud jams, you have the idea. So music moves us: not just emotionally, but physically. To me, that duplicitous sensory experience is just one of the things that makes it awesome.</description>
